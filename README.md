Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into your terminal. It provides lightweight access to Gemini, giving you the most direct path from your prompt to our model.

## üöÄ Why Gemini CLI?

- **üéØ Free tier**: 60 requests/min and 1,000 requests/day with personal Google account
- **üß† Powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Access to 1M token context window
- **üîß Built-in tools**: Google Search grounding, file operations, shell commands, web fetching
- **üîå Extensible**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for custom integrations
- **üíª Terminal-first**: Designed for developers who live in the command line
- **üõ°Ô∏è Open source**: Apache 2.0 licensed

## üì¶ Installation

### Quick Install

#### Run instantly with npx

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.
2. **Run the CLI:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
   ```

   Or install it with:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
   ```

   Then, run the CLI from anywhere:

   ```bash
   gemini
   ```

### With Homebrew

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
2. **Install the CLI:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   brew install gemini-cli
   ```

   Then, run the CLI from anywhere:

   ```bash
   gemini
   ```

### Common Configuration steps

3. **Pick a color theme**
4. **Authenticate:** When prompted, sign in with your personal Google account. This will grant you up to 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 model requests per day using Gemini.

You are now ready to use the Gemini CLI!

## Running from Local Development

If you've cloned this repository and want to run your local version (e.g., to test modifications or add features like hooks):

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run the CLI locally:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Make it globally available** (optional):
   
   Using npm link:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```
   
   Or create an alias in your shell config:
   ```bash
   alias gemini="node /path/to/gemini-cli/bundle/gemini.js"
   ```

### Use a Gemini API key:

The Gemini API provides a free tier with [100 requests per day](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#free-tier) using Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits (with a paid plan):

1. Generate a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key.

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

3. (Optionally) Upgrade your Gemini API project to a paid plan on the API key page (will automatically unlock [Tier 1 rate limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-1))

### Use a Vertex AI API key:

The Vertex AI API provides a [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview) using express mode for Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits with a billing account:

1. Generate a key from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/api-keys).
2. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key and set GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI to true

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
   ```

3. (Optionally) Add a billing account on your project to get access to [higher usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/quotas)

For other authentication methods, including Google Workspace accounts, see the [authentication](./docs/cli/authentication.md) guide.

## Hooks System

Gemini CLI includes a hooks system that allows you to run custom scripts in response to various events during CLI operation. This enables workflow automation, logging, monitoring, and integration with external tools.

### Configuration

Hooks are configured in your settings file (`~/.gemini/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "name": "file-tracker",
      "command": "/path/to/your/hook-script.js",
      "events": ["PreToolUse", "PostToolUse"],
      "tools": ["read_file", "write_file", "replace"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Hook Events

- **PreToolUse**: Called before a tool is executed
- **PostToolUse**: Called after a tool completes
- **Stop**: Called when the CLI session ends
- **Notification**: Called for system notifications  
- **SubagentStop**: Called when a subagent stops
- **PreCompact**: Called before conversation compaction

### Hook Script Format

Hook scripts receive JSON input via stdin and should exit with status code 0 for success or 2 to block execution:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const fs = require('fs');

// Read hook data from stdin
let inputData = '';
process.stdin.on('data', chunk => inputData += chunk);
process.stdin.on('end', () => {
  const data = JSON.parse(inputData);
  
  // Process the hook data
  console.log(`Tool used: ${data.tool_name}`);
  console.log(`Agent: ${data.agent_type}`); // 'gemini'
  
  // Exit with 0 for success, 2 to block
  process.exit(0);
});
```

The hooks system is compatible with Claude Code hooks, allowing you to use the same hook scripts across both tools.

## Examples

Once the CLI is running, you can start interacting with Gemini from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project/
gemini
> Write me a Gemini Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

## Fork Build & Release Process

This fork maintains a feature branch (`add-hooks-feature`) that is continuously rebased on the upstream `main` branch to stay in sync with the original Google Gemini CLI project.

### Building the Project

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build packages:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:packages
   ```

3. **Create the distributable bundle:**
   ```bash
   node esbuild.config.js
   ```
   This creates `bundle/gemini.mjs` - a self-contained executable that users can run with Node.js.

### Creating Releases

1. **Rebase on upstream main:**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream main
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Resolve any conflicts and push:**
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin add-hooks-feature
   ```

3. **Build the bundle:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:packages
   node esbuild.config.js
   ```

4. **Create a GitHub release:**
   ```bash
   gh release create v0.X.X bundle/gemini.mjs \
     --title "v0.X.X - Release Title" \
     --notes "Release notes here" \
     --target add-hooks-feature \
     --latest
   ```

The release will include the `gemini.mjs` file that users can download and run directly.

### Using Released Versions

Users can download the `gemini.mjs` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/principle-md/gemini-cli/releases) page and run:
```bash
node gemini.mjs
```
